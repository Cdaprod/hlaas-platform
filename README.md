# Home Lab as a Service (HLaaS) - Platform Repository (Python-focused)

This repository is the heart of the Home Lab as a Service (HLaaS) project, focusing on the Python-based platform that orchestrates, manages, and deploys services within a home lab environment.

## Overview

The HLaaS platform is designed with automation, scalability, and ease of use in mind, leveraging Python for its robust ecosystem and flexibility. This repository contains the Python application code, dependencies, and utility scripts that constitute the platform's core functionality.

## Repositories

HLaaS comprises several repositories, each catering to specific aspects of the service:

- **[hlaas-platform](https://github.com/cdaprod/hlaas-platform)** (this repository): Central Python application and platform logic.
- **[hlaas-infra](https://github.com/cdaprod/hlaas-infra)**: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for resource management.
- **[hlaas-ci-cd](https://github.com/cdaprod/hlaas-ci-cd)**: CI/CD pipelines and automation scripts.
- **[hlaas-docs](https://github.com/cdaprod/hlaas-docs)**: Documentation for the HLaaS ecosystem.
